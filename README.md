### What is Iceberg?

Iceberg is a CLI application used for mapping the code dependencies in C# projects/solutions and generating basic [DGML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/directed-graph-markup-language-dgml-reference?view=vs-2022) code maps.

### Demo (Iceberg CLI)

![Iceberg CLI Demo](https://github.com/david-acker/Iceberg/blob/main/docs/demo/IcebergCLI.gif)

### Prerequisites

- The 'DGML editor' component must be installed in order to view code maps in Visual Studio. This component is not installed by default and must be added using the Visual Studio Installer. In the Visual Studio Installer, click 'Modify' for your preferred version of Visual Studio, click the 'Individual Components' tab, and search for 'DGML editor'. Click the checkbox next to 'DGML editor' and then click 'Modify' at the bottom right hand corner of the installer to add the component.

### Basic CLI Commands

>
> **load** - Loads the specified solution file or project file(s). Automatically unloads the currently loaded solution or project(s).
> 
> `load [-p|--path <file path(s)>]`
> 
> Options:
> `-p | --path` (required) The file path of a single solution file (.sln) or one or more project files (.csproj).

> 
> **unload** - Unloads the currently loaded solution or projects(s).
> 
> `unload`
> 
> Options: None

>
> **map** - Generates a dependency graph.
> 
> `map [-f|--flow {d|downstream, u|upstream}] [-m|--method <method name>] [-c|--class <class name>] [-p|--p <project>] [-d|--distance <distance>]`
> 
> Options:
> `-f | --flow` (required) The "flow"/direction of the dependency map. Upstream {u | upstream} maps all method calls which the entry point is directly or indirectly dependent on (i.e. other methods invoked inside the body of the entry point method). Downstream {d | downstream} maps all method calls which are directly or indirectly dependent on the entry point (i.e. other methods which invoke the entry point method).
> 
> `-c | --class` (required) The name of the class to use as the entry point when mapping.
>
> `-m | --method` The name of a specific method to use as the entry point when mapping. If none is provided, all methods defined on the class will be included in the generated map.
> 
> `-p | --project` The name of a specific project to search for entry points in. If a provided, only this project will be searched. Otherwise, all available projects will be searched.
> 
> `-d | --distance` The maximum distance to map from the entry point. If provided, the generated map will only include dependencies which are no more than n degrees of separation away from the entry point. If not provided, all dependencies will be fully mapped.

>
> **view** - Opens the last generated dependency graph (for the current session) using the default application (e.g. Visual Studio's DGML Viewer).
> 
> `view`
>
> Options: None
